sorry my phone died.It's nothing I'm fine.These allegations are completely unfounded.the company was not aware of any wrong doing.I love you.We heard anywhere from 10 to 200 lies a day,and we spend much of our history coming up the ways to detect them.from the evil torch devices to polygraphes blood pressure and breathing monitors voice stress-analyzers,eye trackers infrand brain scanners,and even 400 ponds electroensyphologrammes,but authought such tools have worked under certain circumstance most can be fooled with enough preperation and none are onsidered reliable enough to even be addmisible in court.But what if the problem is not with the techniques but the underlying assumptions that lying spurs physiological changes what if we take a more direct approch using communication science to analyze the lies themselves on a psycological level we lie partly to paint a better picture of ourselves connect to the fatacies with the persion we wish we were rather than the person we are But while our brain is busy dreaming it's letting plenting signals slip by OUr conscious only controls about 5% of our congnitive functions including communication while the other 95% occours beyond our awareness and according to the leterature on reality monitoring stories based on imagined experiences are qualitively different from those based on real experiences this suggest creating a faul story about a personal topic takes work and result in a different pattern of language use.A technology known as linguistic text analysis has helped to identify four such common patterns in the sub conscious languages of deceptionFirst liers refers theselves less when making decepted statments they write or talk more about others  often using the third person to distance and distanssec themselves from their lie which sounds more false"Abosolutely no party took place at these house" or "I didn't host a party here"Second lires tend to be more negative,because on a subconcious level they feel guity about lie for exemple a lier might say something like Sorry my stupid phone battery died I hate that thing Thied liers typically ecplain events in single terms since our brain struggle to build a complex lie Judgment and evaluation are complex thingd for our brain to cumpute as a US President once famesly insisted I didn't not have sexal relations with that woman and finally even though liers keep descriptions simple they tend use longer snd more converlude sentence structure inserint unnecessary words inrelevent bur factual sounding details in order to pad the lie Another Present confronted with a scandal proclaimed I can say cateorically this investigation ndicades no one on the White house staff no one in the administration presently emploied was involved in this very bissare incident Les'apply linguistic analysis to some famous examples Take seven-time Tour to Frence winner Lance Armstrong when compraring a 2005 interviewwhich he had denyied to takint performance-enhancing drugs to a 2013 interview in which he admitted it,his use personal announce increased by nearly three quarters. Note the contrast beetween the following two quotes.First OK you known a guy in french in a pregin laboratory open up you sample you known Jean Francis so and so and he tests it and you got a phone call from a mewspaper that says we found you to be positive six times for EPO Second I lost myselvf in all of that I'm sure that there would be any people that could be handle it , but I certainly couldn't handle it and I was used to controlling everything in my life I controlled every outcome in my life In his denial Armstrong described hyperhtetical thinking focused on someone else removing himself from the situation entirely IN his admission he owned his statement delving into his personal emotions and motivations But the use of personal pronounce is only one indication of deception.Let's look at another exemple from former senerter and US presidential candidate John Edwards:I only know that he apprent father had said publicly that he is the father of the baby I also have not been engaged in any activity of anydiscription that requested agree to or support payments of any kind women or to the apprent father of the baby Not only  that is a pretty long-winded way to say the baby isn't mine But Edwards never calls the other parties by name instead say that baby the women and the apprent father Now let's see what he had say later admitting preternity I am Quinn's father I willdo everything in my power to provide love and support she deserves the statement short direct calling the child by name and addressing his role in her life. So how can you apply these lies techniques to you life First remember that many of the lies that we accounter on a daily bases are far less serieus than these exemples and might even be harmless But it's still worthwhile to be aware of  t cludes  like minimal self-reference negative language aimple explinations and coveluted phrasing it just might help you avoiding an overvalue stack an ineffective product,or even a terrible relationship
