sorry my phone died.It's nothing I'm fine.These ==allegations== are completely unfounded.the company was not aware of any ==wrongdoing==.I love you.We heard anywhere from 10 to 200 lies a day,and we spend much of our history coming up ==with== ways to detect them.from the ==medieval== ==torture== devices to polygraphes blood pressure and breathing monitors voice stress-analyzers,eye trackers ==infrared== brain scanners,and even the 400 ponds ==electroencephalogram==,but althought such tools have worked under certain circumstances most can be fooled with enough preperation and none are considered reliable enough to even be addmisible in court.But what if the problem is not with the techniques but the underlying assumption that lying ==spurs== ==physiological== changes what if we took a more direct approch using communication science to analyze the lies themselves on a psycological level we lie partly to paint a better picture of ourselves ==connecting== our ==fantasies== to the persion we wish we were rather than the person we are But while our brain is busy dreaming it's letting plenty of signals slip by Our conscious mind only controls about 5% of our congnitive function including communication while the other 95% ==occours== beyond our awareness and according to the literature on reality monitoring stories based on imagined experiences are ==qualitatively== different from those based on real experiences this suggest that creating a false story about a personal topic takes work and results in a different pattern of language use.A technology known as linguistic text analysis has helped to identify four such common patterns in the ==subconscious== languages of deception.First ==liars== ==reference== theselves less when making ==deceptive== statments they write or talk more about others  often using the third person to distance and ==disassociate== themselves from their lie which sounds more false"Abosolutely no party took place at these house" or "I didn't host a party here"Second lires tend to be more negative,because on a subconscious level they feel guity about lying for exemple a liar might say something like Sorry my stupid phone battery died I hate that thing Third liars typically ecplain events in simple terms since our brain struggle to build a complex lie Judgment and evaluation are complex things for our brain to cumpute as a US President once famously insisted I didn't not have sexal relations with that woman and finally even though liars keep descriptions simple they tend to use longer snd more ==convoluted== sentence structure ==inserting== unnecessary words and ==inrrelevant== but factual sounding details in order to pad the lie Another President confronted with a scandal proclaimed I can say ==categorically== that this investigation indicades no one on the White house staff no one in the administration presently employed was involved in this very ==bizarre== incident Les't apply linguistic analysis to some famous examples Take seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong when compraring a 2005 interviewwhich he had denied taking performance-enhancing drugs to a 2013 interview in which he admitted it,his use personal ==pronouns== increased by nearly three quarters. Note the contrast beetween the following two quotes.First OK you known a guy in french in a Parisian laboratory opens up you sample you known Jean Francis so and so and he tests it and you got a phone call from a newspaper that says we found you to be positive six times for EPO Second I lost myself in all of that I'm sure that there would be other people that ==couldn't== handle it , but I certainly couldn't handle it and I was used to controlling everything in my life I controlled every outcome in my life In his denial Armstrong described a ==hypothetical==  situation focused on someone else removing himself from the situation entirely In his admission he owns his statements ==delving== into his personal emotions and motivations But the use of personal ==pronouns== is just one ==indicator== of deception.Let's look at another exemple from former Senator and US presidential candidate John Edwards:I only know that the ==apparent== father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby I also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apprent father of the baby Not only is that a pretty long-winded way to say the baby isn't mine But Edwards never calls the other parties by name instead say that baby the women and the ==apparent== father Now let's see what he had say later admitting ==parernity== I am Quinn's father I will do everything in my power to provide her with the love and support she deserves the statement is short and direct calling the child by name and addressing his role in her life. So how can you apply these ==lie-spotting== techniques to you life First remember that many of the lies we enccounter on a daily bases are far less serieus than these exemples and may even be harmless But it's still worthwhile to be aware of  telleale clues  like minimal self-references negative language simple explinations and ==convoluted== phrasing it just might help you avoid an overvalue ==stock== an ineffective product,or even a terrible relationship
