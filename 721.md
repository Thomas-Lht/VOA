When I was 27 years old,I left very demanding job and management consolting.For a job that was even more demanding--teaching.When to teaching seventh graders math in the new york city's public schools.And like any teacher ,I made quizes and tests and give homeworks and assignments when work came back I calculated grades.What struct me was that I cue was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.Some of my strongest performers didn't not have strusphurique IQ scores.Some of my smartest kids were doing so well and that got me thinking kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math sure they are hard,racios,decemos the area of a paralogramme but these concepts are not possible and I was firmly convensed that every one of my students could learn meterial if they work hard long enough after several more years of teaching I came to the conclution that what we need in education is a much better understanding students and learning from motivational prespective from a phycological perspective.And education the one thing we known how to mesure best is IQ.But what if doing well in school and in life depende much more that your ability to learn quickly and easily.So I left the classroom and went to gradute school to become a phycologist.In studing kids and adult in all sets of super chalging settings and in every study my questions was who is successful here and why My research team and I went to western point military accademy we tried to predict which kedes would stay in military training and which would drop out we went to the national spellingbee and try to predict which children would advanced farest in compitition .we studied ruky teachers working in realy tough neighbourhoods asking which teaachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year and of those who will be the most effective at improving learning outcome for there students we partener with private companys asking which of these scalls of peoples are going to keep their jobs and who's gonna earn the most money and all those very defferent contest one charactistice emerged as a significent perdictor of success and it wasn't social intalligence wasn't good looks physical health and it wasn't IQ.It was grit.Grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals.Grit is having staminan.Grit is sticking with your future.Day in day out not just for the week not just for the month but for years and working realy hard to make that future a reality grid is living life like a merthon not a sprint .A few years ago I starting studing grid in chichargo public schools I ask thousand high school juniors to take grid qestionaires and we did around more than a year to see who would graduate turns out that grider kids were more significantly to graduate  even I mesured them on every characristic I could mesure thinks like family income standedized achievement test scores even how safe kid felt when they were at school So it's not just that west point or the national spellingbee that grid matters its also in school especials for kis that risks for droping out to me the most shocking thing for grid is how little we know how little science know about building it every days parents and teachers asked me how do I build grid in kids what did I do to teach kids a soild work I think How do I keep the motivated for the long run the honest answer is I don't know what I do know is that telling dusn't make you griddy outr data show very clearly that there are many tanting individals who simply do nor follow through on there commitments In fact in our data grid is even unrelated or even inverslately related mesures of talent so for the best idear i heared about building grid in kids is something called grouth mind set This is an idea developed by Stanford university CW and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can changed with your effort doctor D show that when kids reads and learned about the brain and how it changes and grows in responsced challenge there are much more likely to perserver when they fail beecause they don't believe faileur is a premenet condition So grouth mind set is a great idea for building grids but we need more and that' where I'am going to end my remarks because that's where we are that's the world that stands before us we need to take our best ideas our strongest intuations and we need to test them we need to be mesure whether we've been successful and we have to be willing to fail to be wrong to start over again with lessons learded in other words we need to be griddy about getting our kids gridder
