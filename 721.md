When I was 27 years old,I left very demanding job ==in== management consulting.For a job that was even more demanding--teaching.I went to teaching seventh graders math in the new york city public schools.And like any teacher ,I made quizzes and tests I give homeworks and assignments when the work came back I calculated grades.What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.Some of my strongest performers didn't have ==stratospheric== IQ scores.Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well and that got me thinking the kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math sure they are hard,==ratios==,==decimals== the area of a ==parallelogram== but these concepts are not impossible and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough after several years of teaching I came to the conclution that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from motivational prespective from a phycological perspective.In education the one thing we known how to ==measure== best is IQ.But what if doing well in school and in life depends on  much more that your ability to learn quickly and easily.So I left the classroom and I went to graduate school to become a phychologist.I start studing kids and adults in all kinds of super challeging settings and in every study my questions was who is successful here and why My research team and I went to west point military accademy we tried to predict which ==cadets== would stay in military training and which would drop out we went to the national spellingbee and try to predict which children would advanced farthest in compitition .we studied ==rookie== teachers working in realy tough neighbourhoods asking which teaachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year and of those who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students we ==partnered== with private companies asking which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs and who's going to earn the most money In all those very defferent contexts one ==characteristic== emerged as a significent perdictor of success and it wasn't social intalligence It wasn't good looks physical health and it wasn't IQ.It was grit.Grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals.Grit is having ==stamia==.Grit is sticking with your future.Day in day out not just for the week not just for the month but for years and working realy hard to make that future a reality grid is living life like it's a ==marathon== not a ==sprint== .A few years ago I starting studing grid in chicago public schools I I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit qestionnaires and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate  even when I match them on every characteristic I could mesure things like family income ==standardized== achievement test scores even how safe kid felt when they were at school So it's not just at west point or the national spellingbee that grit matters it's also in school especially for kis at risk for droping out to me the most shocking thing for grit is how little we know how little science knows about building it every days parents and teachers asked me how do I build grit in kids what do I do to teach kids a soild work ==ethic== How do I keep the motivated for the long run the honest answer is I don't know what I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty our data show very clearly that there are many ==talented== individuals who simply do nor follow through on their commitments In fact in our data grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent so far the best idea i've heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset This is an idea developed at Stanford university by Crol Dweck and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change with your effort doctor Dweck show that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge there are much more likely to perservere when they fail because they don't believe that faileure is a ==premanent== condition So growth mindset is a great idea for building grids but we need more and that's where I'am going to end my remarks because that's where we are that's the world that stands before us we need to take our best ideas our strongest ==intuitions== and we need to test them we need to measure whether we've been successful and we have to be willing to fail to be wrong to start over again with lessons learded in other words we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier
